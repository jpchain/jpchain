Now is the time for a "post-blockchain" protocol that adheres to the progressive principles set forth by Satoshi Nakamoto. Since the launch of blockchain in 2009, over a decade ago, research has moved forward and improved ways of achieving the promise of a vibrant decentralized world. Weâ€™re concerned that the state of DLTs is slowly moving towards centralized, permissioned, and leader-based environments in which a small number of individuals are in control of each network, thereby creating liabilities and single points of failure. In contrast, at JPChain, we cultivate an open culture, a scientific approach, and a constant flow of ideas that can guarantee true progression of the domain.
